\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we try to show the importance of having client side compilation. We conduct our study using Pyodide as a base, and answer the questions pertaining to bugs and implementation in a project. We realize the possibilities this brings to an organisation both interms of performarnce and resources required. \\
We also perform a bug analysis using a previously done research and validate the approaches and bugs from that paper. \\
We believe there is a huge scope by moving the compilation to the client side for all services that require a backend server for processing. This is because, even mobile devices are releasing with processors sufficient enough to run even AI models. This would greatly improve the lags caused by network latency and server loads and greatly improve the user experience. \\
