\section{Future Work}
As the scope of this research was small we have a lot of suggestions for future work. We could see a lot of bugs that could be further categorised to be more specific to pyodide, doing a continuation of the comparitive study would help better in validating the bugs paper. \\
We could also look at the performance of the pyodide compiler and see how it compares to an actual backend compiler, this would ideally be done through A/B testing on the virtual labs platform itself. \\
A study on user experience and user feedback could be done to validate the proposal. \\
The proposal could be validated by a larger audience with a working solution deployed on the virtual labs platform. Considering the small time frame it was not possible to get the solution deployed on the platform. \\
