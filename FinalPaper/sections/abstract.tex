    WebAssembly compilers are tools that allow users to compile their code into the WebAssembly format. This format can be run on web browsers and other platforms that support the WebAssembly standard. We look at practical application of a webassembly compiler running on client side and study the challenges that arise in doing so. We present a prototype implementation of a webassembly compiler that runs on client side and discuss the challenges that we faced in implementing it. We also present a solution to the challenges that we faced.
